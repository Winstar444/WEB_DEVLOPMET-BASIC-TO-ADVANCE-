<!-- we use "UL" tags to  create an unordered list inside that we us "li" tag  to create  a  list items  
in this there are two types of order on is ordered other one is unordered  the only diff is that in  unordered we can show any object
at any where  in the list but in ordered we have to show particular data at particular position example for ordered one is 
1:chikken.
2:paneer. 
FOR UNOREDERED WE USE <UL> TAGS
& FOR ORDERED WE USE OL TAGS 
in ordered we can change type just writing after it -->

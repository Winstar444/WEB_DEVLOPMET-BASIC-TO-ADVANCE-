// variable is the name of the storage location ( they are basically container to store data values )
// examples:- a=10; b="hello world"; c=true;
// var, let, const are the three ways to declare a variable in javascript
/*  we basically dnt use var  we use con for values which will not change and let which will get changed */

/* DATA TYPES :-
   PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES 
   NUMBER, BOOLEAN , NUM , SYMBOL , STRING, UNDEFINED, BIGHT
     TYPE OF IS A  OPERAATOR WHICH TELLS WHICH TYPE OF DATA TYPE IS IT */
a = 10;
typeof a; // it will return number

/* operations 
a+b  etc */
a=10;
b=20;
sum=a+b
// it will give 30
// there are similar operations for subtraction, multiplication , division 
// but there are two new one modulo (reamainder operator) and exponentiation(power operator)
10 % 3 // it will give 1 as remainder(modulo operator)
2 ** 3 // it will give 8 as 2 power 3(power operator)


// NAN means not a number IN JS IT IS PROPERTY OF NUMBER TYPE
/* EXAMPLES ARE 0/0 , NaN - 1,NaN * 1, NAN + NAN */

// OPERATOR pRECEDENCE
// NOTHING JUSTBODMAS RULE IT MEANS BRACKET OF DIVISION MULTIPLICATION ADDITION SUBTRACTION
// IF SAME PRECEDENCE THEN LEFT TO RIGHT EVALUATION

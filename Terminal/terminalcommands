# flags:- basically flags are used to modify the behavior of a command. For example, if we want to list all the files in a directory including hidden files we can use the flag -a with the ls command like this: ls -a
# man ls - give info about ls command
# if we write man infront of any comand it will give us the manual of that command and it will also give us the flags that we can use with that command

#  rm :-remove a file or directory
#  rmdir :-remove an empty directory
